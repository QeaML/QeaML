### Yo dude, whasap

My name is qeaml *(pronounced kee-mil)* and I do coding and programming and developing.

My favorite language is Python, but I vibe with Go more.

The programming project I work on the most at this moment in time is [ximfect](https://github.com/QeaML/ximfect). I'm not really planning to make anything big or revolutionary, I just like the satisfaction of running that build command and a nice, usable execudable popping out. That really gets me going!

Here's a short list of things I do:

* Write code (duh)
* Make music
* Mess around with Blender (3D)
* Play too much Minecraft
* Speak English better than my native language (poland be like)
* Record myself saying dumb stuff

And some other stuff sometimes.
